    <h3>"The differances between Borders, Margins, and Padding"
        <p class="padding">The main differances between the three are where they take place. Since all content in HTML is rectangle in shape think of them as boxes. The content is in a box. The margain is how far the box is from the edge of the screen. The border surrounds the box, and the padding is how far from the edge of the box the content will appear. From doing a quick google search I found this image for a visual explaination. </p>
        <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/D9nU6.gif">
        <p class="padding">Examples between all three are very similar as they affect the content in similar fashions. First you would to indicate the class in the html for the paragraph. It would look something like this.
          <br> < p class="border">some text.< /p></br> and the accompanying CSS would look like 
          <br>p.border {</br>border-style:dotted;
          <br>border-width:2px;</br>
          <br>}</br> as for the padding and margains just sub out the border for padding and margains and you also have options like top, bottom, left and right if you want seperate sides to have differant features.
