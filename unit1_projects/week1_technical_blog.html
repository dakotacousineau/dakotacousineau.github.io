    <h2>"You can read my thoughts! You must have that ESPN."</h2>
    <p>The first website I chose almost feels like a cop out because it is so big, but it is probably one of the most efficient places to get information on sports <a href= "http://www.espn.com" target="ESPN"ESPN</a>ESPN</a>. I know they are biased towards certain regions and teams but no one covers sports like ESPN and if your pressed for time thats the place to get up to speed. The website itself seems a little overwheming and busy when you first load the page with its large image with tons of other hover links and other updates. On second look everything serves a purpose and directs the user through a <bold>very</bold> broad field and gets your to informational links with the minimal amount of clicks. I imagine they have a pretty extensive programing team to keep the content up to date and to handle the volume they do.</p>
    <h3>The place where memes come from</h3>
      <p>My second site is probably one of my biggest time wasters the all and mighty site <a href= "http://www.imgur.com" target="imgur"imgur</a>imgur</a>. This site looks like it is a bunch of images that have the potential to go viral and then be copied and reposted to just about every other social media site there is. It is simple and efficient the only thing that is hard is if your trying to navigate certain galleries. the search function is not very forgiving. 

    <h4>The site of Michigan</h4>
      
      <p> My third website is a site that allows me to be up to speed on local issues that my family in Michigan might talk about and makes me feel like I am still apart of their world. <a href= "http://www.mlive.com" target="mlive"mlive</a>mlive</a>. The site covers everything about Michigan from local news, politics, sports to prom photos for the local high schools. It is very niche based in that it only covers Michigan. I like to read the articles about things affecting my parents so when I call them I can feel like I am still apart of their life. The site it self is plain and easy to navigate with drop down menus. I do wish they would use something other than eye ball blinding white as the background. It does seem low budget in how it is designed. </p>
