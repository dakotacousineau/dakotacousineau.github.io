    <h3>"Classes"
        <p class="padding">Since Ruby is an Object Oriented Language the main feature is objects. Objects can be grouped by class which can include multiple methods and variables. Class is important because it allows the programmer to only have to list variables and methods once and they are inherited by the objects withen the class. This lets each new object to automatically have those attributes. 

        I personally found instance variables to be very useful. Instance variables allows any method in the class to modify the class variable and are easy to recignize as they use a single @ symbol before the variable.  </p>
