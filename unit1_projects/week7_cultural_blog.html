    <p class="padding"> When I think of some of my proudest and hapiest moments, the values that come to mind are: Accomplishment, Achievement, Adventure, Competition, Excellence, Merit, Recongnition. Of those values Competition is important to me because it gives me benchmark for myself and I try to hold myself to my ideal version of myself. Competition allows me to push myself more than I would otherwise. I always try to live up to these values and others as I want to be my ideal person. If I do not live up to my standards of judgement how can I have any kind of opinion on others. 

        The last topic someone asked my advice on was an internal company issue with an individual and they wanted my opinion on what would be the best way to approach a solution to that problem. 

        I try to focus on myself and not on others. If I act in accordance with what I believe to be right I should not care what others think. I will follow my own path and do the best that I can and make the choices that I can make. If it is not in my control then why worry but if it is then I shall do what I deem the best coarse of action would be.
