    <h3>"Why is JavaScript so popular?"
        <p class="padding">JavaScript is one of the most popular languages used right now but the question asked is why? I'm here to tell you JavaScript has many merits that on there own make the language handy but combined into one they make it simply undeniable in the current marketplace. It is easy to learn making it widespread and is supported by every browser. One of the reasons it is so easy to learn in that it is easy to edit and incase you do make mistakes it tells you where it errors so debugging is not such a chore as other languages. The language itself has many toolkits available and it makes the browsers do the heavy lifting when loading freeing up the server for other tasks and minimizing memory issues.</p> 

        <p class="padding">No language is perfect however. JavaScript is limited in that it is not as flexable as other languages such as Ruby and not as easy to read. Overall though JavaScript is here to dominate for the forseeable future. </p>
