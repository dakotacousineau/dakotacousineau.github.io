    <h3>"OOP vs Functional Programming"
        <p class="padding">The main difference between Object Oriented Programming or OOP and Functional Programming or FP is the expressions your going to use and choosing which to use for your code is going to largely depend on how you think your code is going to evolve. For OOP youâ€™re going to use more with classes that extend the existing data with more methods while FP is more writing new functions to work with the existing data. One is not superior to the other they are just different thought patterns. Object-oriented languages are good when you have a fixed set of operations on things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new things. While Functional languages are good when you have a fixed set of things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new operations on existing things. </p>
