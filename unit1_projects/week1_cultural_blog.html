    <h2>Such Blog much Culture</h2>
    <p class="padding">First I don't think I have ever sat through an enire hour video of nothing but someone talking and enjoyed it. Second this video was inspiring in it's information and that I can control my own destiny and I can get as much out of this program as the effort I put forth. I think that I am going to do very well in the dbc enviroment and I am hoping that I can take full advantage of the this opprotunity. I am nervous about my own limitations but this video has reassured me that if I put forth the effort I can do this. 

      I was very skeptical of DBC from the beggining and not getting scammed like so many others have posted on their blogs. It is reassuring that I'm not the only one who was wary of dropping that kind of money of the possibity to make your life what you want. Overall I want to attack next week with a new vigor and really smash this next step</p>
