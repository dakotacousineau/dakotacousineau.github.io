    <p class="padding">I'm an abstract sequential kinaesthetic learner. The most frustrating thing I have found with DBC is the order of information is not always linear, and there are not enough visual aids or representations of the code. With my learning style having more examples would greatly benefit me and to help with this I usually look elsewhere. I do learn best in small groups and seem to make the most strides in office hours or in the GPS meetings. I am looking foward to getting to Chicago because it is in that enviroment that I think I will flourish.

      Ways I can improve and expand my learning styles is by working with others and not limiting myself to only some of the source material. Hopefully I can expand my written and audio portions to make the most of today sociatal trends.</p>
