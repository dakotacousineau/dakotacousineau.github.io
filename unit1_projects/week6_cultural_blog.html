    <p class="padding"> I think the best way to fight stereotype threat is to keep an open mind and evaluate people based on actions. Bringing your own preconceptions about anyone one person or idea is the first step to stereotype threat. These preconceptions may hinder your own ideas in turn. I have felt some stereotype threat in that I feel added pressure to perform. I can imagine that it is worse for other races and have it first hand from my friend Yen. Yen is Taiwanese and has never been good at math. In high school he always made light of this but I think he really cared and was hurt when other students of Asian decent made fun of him with things like he was not representing them well.
