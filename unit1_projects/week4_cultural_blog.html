    <p class="padding">Net neutrality is a major issue facing the tech world and world at large. The basic concept is up unto this point no information or site on the web has advantage of loading faster or getting their information to the user quicker than anyone else. It is a completely equal playing field for everyone. This is important because it maximizes growth and chances for the “little guy”. If you have a great site and people start visiting it they can load just as fast as huge corporate sites like espn.

 The problem is service providers are trying to charge companies to get their information to the end user. This will stagnate the internet making it so those with the most money can get their information out their and the internet will start to look like the special interests lobbyists that currently are entwined in our political system.
