    <p class="padding"> Pairing to solve challenges was great. It allows for devolpment to happen a lot quicker than if I am working on the issue myself. I really like the shared joy from solving something together but on the other hand I found the communication is difficult since you are not on site with the person. Therefore you really need to describe what you are trying to do, what you are looking at and the actions you are trying to accomplish. 

    I used to be in sports so I understand you can't improve if you don't get negative feedback. I took the reccamendations in stride and think that I am a much better communicator now than I was before. Writing feedback was a little difficult in that I am not that comfortable in telling others their faults.
